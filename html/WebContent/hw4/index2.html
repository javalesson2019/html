        <h4>What is lorem ipsum?</h4>
        <div>
            In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual
            form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final
            copy is available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which
            allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
            <br />
            Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a first-century BCE text by
            Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.
            <br />
            Versions of the lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was
            popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world
            in the mid-1980s when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing
            program PageMaker. Other popular word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since adopted lorem
            ipsum as well.
        </div>
        <h4>Where does it come from?</h4>
        <div>
            "Lorem ipsum" text is derived from sections 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum.[1]
            <br />
            It is not known exactly when the text obtained its current standard form; it may have been as late as the
            1960s. Dr Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar who was the publication's director at Hampden–Sydney College
            in Virginia, discovered the source of the passage sometime before 1982 while searching for instances of the
            Latin word "consectetur" ("that [he/she/it] pursue", subjunctive), rarely used in classical
            literature.[2][a] The physical source of the lorem ipsum text may be the 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition
            of the De Finibus, where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with
            "Neque porro quisquam est qui do-" and continues on page 36 with "lorem ipsum ...", suggesting that the
            galley type of that page was mixed up to make the dummy text seen today.[4]
        </div>
        <h4>Where can I get some?</h4>
        <div>
            The original version appears in the 1913 Loeb Classical Library Edition of the De Finibus, Book 1, sections
            32–33[5]. The relevant section of Cicero as printed in the source is reproduced below with fragments used in
            lorem ipsum underlined. Letters in brackets were added to lorem ipsum and were not present in the source
            text:

            This is H. Rackham's translation as printed in the Loeb Classical Library edition with underlining added for
            the translation of the text found in the example of the lorem ipsum[5]:
            <br />
            [32] But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was
            born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
            itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
            encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
            to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
            can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
            who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
            resultant pleasure?
            <br />
            [33] On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
            and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when
            nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
            avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
            frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
            holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse.
